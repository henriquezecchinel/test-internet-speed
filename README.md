This is a simple project to constantly check for your internet connection speed.

## Steps
Run `npm install` to install all packages.
Run `node app.js` to start the application.


The application automatically requests the SpeedTest's API and stores the results in a log file (`network_speed_log.csv`).
The default delay between requests is 5 minutes. You can update the delay as desired.
